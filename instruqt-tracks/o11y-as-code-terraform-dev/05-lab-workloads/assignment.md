üß™ Step 1: Create a Workload
=======================

- A Workload is a collection of everything that you or your team is responsible for monitoring, troubleshooting and improving.
- Workloads are created using a common tag to group all resources together.
- Add this code snippet after `# TODO: Create a workload using the team tag`

```
resource "newrelic_workload" "O11yAsCode" {
  name = var.MY_TEAM_WORKLOAD_NAME
  account_id = (var.NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID)

  # Include entities with a set of tags.
  entity_search_query {
    query = var.MY_TEAM_WORKLOAD_QUERY
  }

  entity_guids = [
    newrelic_one_dashboard_json.imported-dashboard.guid,
    newrelic_one_dashboard_json.custom-dashboard.guid,
  ]
}
```

- Remember to save the file.

- Review `TF_VAR_MY_TEAM_WORKLOAD_QUERY` and `TF_VAR_TAGS` in `o11y/terraform.tfvars`
- Ensure that the `TF_VAR_TAGS` you create are reflected in `TF_VAR_MY_TEAM_WORKLOAD_QUERY`

üß™ Step 2: Link to your workload
=======================

- Create a link to your workload by outputting the permalink.
- Add this code snippet after `# TODO: Output the permalink to the workload`

```
output "my-team-workload" {
  value = newrelic_workload.O11yAsCode.permalink
}
```

- Remember to save the file.

üèÅ Step 3: Finish
