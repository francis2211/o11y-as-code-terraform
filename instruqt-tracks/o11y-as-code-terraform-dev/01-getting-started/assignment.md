üß™ Step 1: Setup applications
=======================

In the root workspace directory, run the `make` command.
It will generate `.env` files for your applications.

```
make
```

üß™ Step 2: Add your New Relic License Keys
=======================

Using the Editor tab, update the `.env` files to add your `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` to each application.

- apps/web-api/.env
- apps/login-service/.env

.env file:
```
NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=AABBCC
```

üèÅ Step 3: Finish
=========

- Verify that everything is working.

```
make up
```

- View the logs from the applications.

```
make logs
```

- Behind the scenes smoke tests are running to simulate load on your applications. In a few minutes, this data will appear in New Relic UI.
